            <h5>DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES</h5>
            <p>We offer varying plans of Hosting Services:</p><br>

            <p><strong>Web Hosting.</strong>
                If you purchase Web Hosting,
                your site is placed within one or more servers and
                resources are shared between many customers on the same
                servers; however, your site is given a unique address (DNS).</p>
            <p>Virtual Private Server (“VPS”). If you purchase VPS, you will
                share a server with other customers, but you will have full
                control over your server space and the complete configuration
                of your virtual instance on the server. You will have administrator (root)
                access and a dedicated IP address.</p><br>
            <h5>LIMITATIONS;ACCOUNT TERMINATION</h5><br>
            <p><strong>Migration of Servers.</strong>
                You acknowledge and agree that as a normal course of business,
                it may be necessary for us to migrate our servers. As a result,
                even if you have a dedicated IP, you may be assigned a different
                IP number. We do not warrant that you will be able to consistently
                maintain your given IP numbers.</p><br>

                upon expiration or termination of your Services, you must discontinue
                use of the Services and relinquish use of the IP addresses and server
                names assigned to you in connection with Services, including pointing
                the domain name system (“DNS”) for your domain name(s) away from our
                servers. Prior to termination of the Services, you are responsible for
                moving your website or server content off our servers. We will not
                transfer or FTP your website or server content to another provider.
